## Project Description

Our project is a comprehensive endeavor to address the IT infrastructure needs of NET2GRID, a forward-thinking company specializing in AI and machine learning services for energy insights based on smart meter data.

**Project Objectives:**

- **Update Core IT Infrastructure:** Our primary goal is to modernize NET2GRID's IT infrastructure to align with the company's vision of sustainable energy. This includes establishing a client-server, domained network that can efficiently oversee NET2GRID's operations.

- **Powershell Script Development:** As a team, we are creating a singular Powershell script capable of transforming a fresh Windows Server installation into a fully functional Domain Controller (DC). This script will automate the deployment of essential services and configurations.

- **AWS EC2 Integration:** We aim to host a portion of NET2GRID's infrastructure on AWS EC2. To ensure secure remote authentication and resource access, we will establish a client-server VPN configuration.

- **Network Access Control:** Due to previous network intrusions, we recognize the importance of robust network access control. Our project includes the deployment of a RADIUS system that raises a captive portal for new network users, authenticating them using Active Directory credentials.

**Project Significance:**

Our project has a significant impact on NET2GRID's operations, and its successful execution will provide:

- A more efficient and secure IT infrastructure.
- A seamless integration of AWS resources.
- Enhanced security measures with network access control.
- A foundation for NET2GRID's vision of sustainable energy.

We look forward to sharing the results of our efforts and are committed to delivering high-quality solutions for NET2GRID.
